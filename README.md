# AppFood
Food ordering application for users. With this application, users can view the list of dishes and food details. 
They can see the option of dishes, whenever you feel good, you can buy and pay for it, food bills will be updated in the order item. When they finish enjoying the food 
they have ordered, they can rate the dish as well as leave a comment about the dish. For the food they like, they can add it to their favorite food item and can 
drop their favorite if the next time the food is no longer delicious. To pay for your order, if you order too much, you can delete items you do not need and pay. 
Note that for payment orders, if there are no orders, the message "no dishes to pay for" will be displayed. For user accounts, they can sign up for additional accounts 
but are granted permissions at the user level, not the staff.
